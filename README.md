This is the Matlab code for PHD-SLAM 2.0, which aims to perform SLAM in the case that the origin of measurements is unknown and, furthermore, miss-detections and clutter are present.

The related paper is: L. Gao, G. Battistelli, and L. Chisci, PHD-SLAM 2.0: efficient SLAM in presence of miss-detections and clutter, IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

The code was programmed by Lin Gao (Email: lingao_1014@126.com).
